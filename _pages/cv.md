Work experience
======

* Security Engineering Intern, Smartsheet _(June 2022 - September 2022)_
  * Designed and implemented an automated AWS cybersecurity response system to detect unusual EC2 activity
  * Developed alerts for notable CloudTrail events, integrated real-time incident reporting with ServiceNow, and automated corrective measures including EC2 disablement and sandboxing.
  * Implemented a commit verification system using Lambda and GitLab API to ensure AWS resource integrity from approved merge requests, enhancing code quality and traceability and ensuring government compliance
  * Manager: Steve Goett

* Undergraduate Researcher, Ozcan Research Group at UCLA _(October 2022 - Present)_
  * Running custom physics-based simulations to develop applications of optical computing to encryption and privacy
  * Trained a machine learning light-propagation model using PyTorch to accept close matches of visual keys while causing
destructive interference for keys of the same class beyond this matching threshold
  * Supervisor: Xilin Yang

* Software Engineering Intern, Zest AI _(June 2022 - September 2022)_
  * Owned end-to-end software development of an internal visualization tool in Python, reducing time taken for decision-making and data science design choices. 
  * Created and extensively documented birdzai, a package for Data Scientists granting a birds-eye view of Zest's data. 
  * Devised class hierarchies as part of a data pipeline for birdzai from Snowflake to AWS s3 buckets for loading and aggregating hundreds of gigabytes of data into cached files under 10 megabytes with parallel optimizations. 
  * Designed intuitive layouts in Streamlit and wrote dozens of graphing functions on top of birdzai allowing for nontechnical members of the Sales team and Client Engagement Managers to grasp underlying data distributions quickly and technical members of the Data Science team to verify data integrity.
  * Manager: Siavash Yasini

* Technical Consulting Intern, PwC _(June 2021 - August 2021)_
  * Worked on digital assistant development as part of the Advisory branch at PwC. 
  * Created process flows, developed interaction variations, and trained chatbots using Microsoft's LUIS and QnA Maker for B2B clients.

* Intern, SIEMENS _(July 2019)_
  * Learnt about the applications of electrical motors at SITRAIN in the SIEMENS factory at Kalwa while assisting on project demonstrations.

* Data Analytics Intern, Points For People _(March 2019)_
  * Interned at Points for People, a charity alliance between Tata Trusts and Strategic Caravan.
  * Learned and implemented data sorting, processing, and presentation techniques on Excel and
  Tableau to boost social media engagement for the platform.
