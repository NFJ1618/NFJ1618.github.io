Hi, I'm Jai Parera, a junior Computer Science student at UCLA minoring in Data Science Engineering. I'm interested in Machine Learning and am involved in research that uses neural networks to develop cryptographic applications of optical computing. Some of my passions include game development (I'm working on a six month project with ACM Students Run Studios), Club Spikeball at UCLA, and creative writing.
